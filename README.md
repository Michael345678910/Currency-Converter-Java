The CurrencyConverter Java program is a currency conversion utility that leverages an external API to fetch exchange rates between various currencies. Within the program, a static map named SYMBOLS_CURRENCIES is defined to map currency symbols to their respective currency codes. The main method parses command-line arguments to extract the amount to convert, input currency, and desired output currency, prompting an error message if essential information is missing. It then utilizes the convertCurrency method to handle the currency conversion process by constructing a URL with the base and target currencies, fetching exchange rate data, and calculating the converted amount. Subsequently, the program invokes the createJsonResponse method to generate a JSON response containing details of the conversion, creating a structured output for the user. Overall, the CurrencyConverter tool showcases how to interact with external APIs, perform currency conversions, and format results in a JSON response for improved user experience and data presentation.
